Flood is an unavoidable natural disaster causing heavy flow of traffic and can also cause severe damage to properties and lives.
For this reason, researchers created a flood detection system to monitor rising water in residential areas.
The implementation of flood alert systems near any major water area or body of water provides critical information that can protect property and save lives.
we are design this system to inform the people about the upcoming flood through notification and alert messages.
For that purpose we are going to use some sensors which will helpful to give information about the flood.
This system provides actual implementation to organizations, communities and individuals interested in establishing and operating flood monitoring and warning systems.
The Arduino Flood Detector System is developed to be one of the fastest method to monitor flood that will help motorists or road user to avoid problem when flood occurred.
